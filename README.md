### Join the Dev Army and help us build the NexKit you love.

It's been a work-in-progress project since 2020, it all started as a PPTOS-based Project.

# NexKit's Chronicles

Over the past four years, I've embarked on a journey of learning and creativity, primarily focused on crafting captivating PowerPoint presentations centered around "Menus and Interfaces." It was during this time that NexKit's initial conception took shape as an add-on for a GDPS (Geometry Dash Private Server), primarily serving as a launcher and modding tool for Geometry Dash enthusiasts in the private server.


As a teaser, here's a little teaser of NexKit Legacy, a project that may be uploaded in the future:

# What we've achieved

Today it is recognized as one of the largest and most innovative PPTOS in history and we are still building this great and magnificent project. We make an effort to provide updates as soon as we can for many years to come since we believe this project will be great.
It may not be something as useful as a real Launcher, but we do this so that we can show how amazing PowerPoint is capable of doing and even make it a great gaming operating system in the future.
