# NexKit is in heavy development!
### Join the Dev Army and help us build the NexKit you love.

NexKit is a gaming-oriented subsystem/launcher based on PowerPoint.
It's been a work-in-progress project since 2020, it all started as a PPTOS-based Project.

## What we've achieved

Today it is recognized as one of the largest and most innovative PPTOS in history and we are still building this great and magnificent project. We make an effort to provide updates as soon as we can for many years to come since we believe this project will be great.
It may not be something as useful as a real Launcher, but we do this so that we can show how amazing PowerPoint is capable of doing and even make it a great gaming operating system in the future.
